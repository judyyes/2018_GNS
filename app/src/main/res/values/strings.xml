    <string name="about_info">Three generations of our family have been playing this solitaire for over 100 years. There are other Napoleon solitaires which can be found with a Google search, but this version is considered to be unique. While we believe it was played by Emperor Napoleon while exiled in Elba, but we cannot confirm this. It is intellectually demanding and not all dealt tableaus are solvable.   \n\n Professor Gerald Ratzer</string>
